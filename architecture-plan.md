# Architecture Plan for Highly Customized Interactive Website

## Overview
This plan outlines the transformation of the existing Next.js employee contracts application into a highly customized, interactive website with a super modern glassy design aesthetic. The project builds on the current structure (Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS 4, HeroUI components, Framer Motion) while introducing advanced glassy effects, improved responsiveness, and enhanced user interactions.

  - Glass: `0 8px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.2)`
  - Hover: `0 12px 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)`
- **Backdrop Filters**:
  - Frosted Glass: `backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%)`
  - Subtle Blur: `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)`

- **Particle Effects**: Subtle floating particles for visual interest

## Responsiveness Strategy

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: 320px - 767px
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1023px
- **Desktop**: 1024px - 1439px
- **Large Desktop**: 1440px+

### Responsive Design Patterns
- **Mobile-First**: Base styles for mobile, progressive enhancement
- **Fluid Typography**: Clamp functions for scalable text
- **Flexible Grids**: CSS Grid and Flexbox with responsive units
- **Touch-Friendly**: Minimum 44px touch targets
- **Performance**: Conditional loading of heavy animations on mobile

### Glass Effect Adaptations
- **Mobile**: Reduced blur radius for performance
- **Tablet**: Medium blur with optimized shadows
- **Desktop**: Full glass effects with advanced filters

## Animation and Interaction Plans

### Page Transitions
- **Route Changes**: Smooth fade transitions between pages
